## RP_Arduino-FileCommand
- - - -
An Arduino library parse commands from a .txt file. 

Inspired from [kroimon](https://github.com/kroimon/Arduino-SerialCommand)

The original version of this library was written by [Steven Cogswell](http://husks.wordpress.com) (published May 23, 2011 in his blog post ["A Minimal Arduino Library for Processing Serial Commands"](http://husks.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/a-minimal-arduino-library-for-processing-serial-commands/)).


This is a totaly modified version.

Tested with esp32

:point_right: After uploading the code, also upload the .txt-file from folder "data" to the SPIFFS of the ESP32
